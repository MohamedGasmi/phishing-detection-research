## 🧑‍💻 My Contribution
- Conducted experiments on feature extraction from phishing websites.  
- Implemented multiple machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM).  
- Led evaluation and analysis of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Co-authored the final paper and contributed to result interpretation.
