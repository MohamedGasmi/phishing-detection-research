## üìë Abstract
Phishing attacks are one of the most prevalent cybersecurity threats, aiming to steal sensitive data by imitating legitimate websites. In this work, we propose and evaluate a machine learning approach to detect phishing URLs by combining **lexical, host, and content-based features**.  

Using a balanced dataset of **31,980 URLs** (15,990 phishing + 15,990 legitimate), we extracted **39 features** and applied different feature selection techniques. We then trained and compared four models: **SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost**.  

The **XGBoost model** achieved the best results with:  
- **Accuracy:** 95.70%  
- **Recall (TPR):** 98.06%  
- **F1-score:** 95.80%  
- **False Negative Rate:** 1.94%  

These results confirm that combining multiple feature categories significantly improves phishing detection performance.

## üßë‚Äçüíª My Contributions
- Built a **balanced dataset** from PhishTank (phishing URLs) and Alexa Top 1M (legitimate sites).  
- Developed Python scripts for **data cleaning, feature extraction, and normalization**.  
- Implemented **feature selection** techniques (Pearson/Spearman correlation, feature importance).  
- Conducted **comparative evaluation** of ML models (SVM, DT, RF, XGBoost).  
- Achieved state-of-the-art performance with **XGBoost**.  
- Co-authored and published the final paper in **EAI Endorsed Transactions on Scalable Information Systems**.
